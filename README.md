# Classic-Model_Data_Analysis_Project

The project focuses on displaying expertise in analyzing data using Excel, specifically with the Classic Models dataset, an open-source MySQL dataset. The dataset was imported into Excel and organized, cleaned, transformed, and modeled to create comprehensive business reports. 

The primary goal was to demonstrate the ability to work with real-world data, clean and transform it, and establish meaningful connections between different data tables to produce actionable business insights to support strategic decision-making. 

Power Query and Power Pivot were used to transform the data, create new columns, and utilize formulas like RELATED to extract information from different tables. 

Various business reports and visualizations, including sales performance reports, customer segmentation analyses, and product line profitability reports, were generated to understand business performance and areas for improvement comprehensively. 

The project also focused on data cleaning to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data by removing duplicates, correcting structural errors, and handling missing values. 

Lastly, the project highlighted proficiency in deriving meaningful insights from complex datasets and expertise in using advanced Excel features such as Power Query and Power Pivot to create impactful business reports that can drive informed decision-making.
